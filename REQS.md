# Project Description

**WARNING**: This is subject to change during the development process. The commands and the flags might differ from the final product.

GNU Finance is a project which was born from the need to compare different financial tools that provide information about companies, this including Yahoo Finance, without
needed 5+ tabs on a browser open. This is a terminal-centered tool which allows you to have up-to-date information about a company by executing a simple command on the terminal. 

A perfect tool for those whose workflow is terminal-based and don't like having to use a browser too much.
